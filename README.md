<h1 align="center">2020 Kaggle ML & DS Survey - EDA</h1>
For the fourth year, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> surveyed its community of data enthusiasts to share trends within a quickly growing field. In this project, I made a few charts that represent the most important data from the survey. It's my first EDA, so it has been made for educational purposes. In addition to the charts, I made a simple Dash visualization that allows the users to filter the data by country and job title.

## Data:
<a href="https://github.com/martinnyakimov/Kaggle-survey-EDA/blob/main/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv">kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv</a>: 39+ questions and 20,036 responses
